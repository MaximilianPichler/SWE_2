Project:<br /><br />
Calculates the distance of an object with an HC-SR04 Sensor.<br />
The distance gets displayed on a 20x4 LCD.
The library used for the (I2C) LCD was created by Lewis Loflin and was modified by in order to work with 20x4 displays.<br />
The distance is also uploaded to a NOSQL Database (hosted by Google firebase).<br />
The website (in the "website" folder) displays a graph of the measured distance over time.<br />
